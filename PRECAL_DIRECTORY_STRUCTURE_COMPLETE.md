---

## Agent Team Configuration

All agents properly configured with correct models:

| Agent | Model | Phase | Purpose |
|-------|-------|-------|---------|
| curriculum-strategist | opus (Opus 4.5) | 3 | Quality verification |
| classwork-creator | sonnet (Sonnet 4.5) | 1 | Create classwork + key |
| homework-creator | sonnet (Sonnet 4.5) | 1 | Create homework + key |
| presenter-creator | sonnet (Sonnet 4.5) | 1 | Create slides |
| resource-specialist | sonnet (Sonnet 4.5) | 1 | Curate videos |
| test-creator | sonnet (Sonnet 4.5) | 2 | Create assessments + key |

---

## Parallel Workflow Process

### For Each Week:

**Phase 1 - Parallel Launch (4 agents simultaneously):**
1. @classwork-creator
2. @homework-creator
3. @presenter-creator
4. @resource-specialist

**Phase 2 - Sequential (after Phase 1):**
5. @test-creator (reads Phase 1 outputs)

**Phase 3 - Parallel Verification (while next week runs):**
6. @curriculum-strategist (reviews all materials)

**Time Estimate:** ~25-30 minutes per week

---

## Prerequisites for Materials Creation

1. ✅ Directory structure (complete)
2. ⏸️ Lesson plan for target week (Week_#_PreCal.docx)

---

## Commands for Verification

### Check Quarter 3 Structure:
```bash
for i in {01..10}; do
  echo "Q3 Week $i: $(ls -1 /Disciplines/precal/quarter_3/week_$i/ | wc -l) folders"
done
```

### Check Quarter 4 Structure:
```bash
for i in {01..06}; do
  echo "Q4 Week $i: $(ls -1 /Disciplines/precal/quarter_4/week_$i/ | wc -l) folders"
done
```

### Verify Resources Folders Exist:
```bash
# Quarter 3
find /Disciplines/precal/quarter_3 -type d -name "resources" | wc -l
# Should return: 10

# Quarter 4
find /Disciplines/precal/quarter_4 -type d -name "resources" | wc -l
# Should return: 6
```

## Next Actions

### Immediate (User):
1. Create lesson plans for each week
2. Ensure Master Coordination Template exists
3. Review and approve agent specifications

### When Ready to Generate Materials (User):
1. For each week, run Phase 1 agents in parallel
2. Monitor completion and run Phase 2 agent
3. Run Phase 3 verification while starting next week
4. Repeat for all 15 weeks

### Expected Timeline:
- **Sequential (old method):** 15 weeks × 50 min = 12.5 hours
- **Parallel (new method):** 15 weeks × 30 min = 7.5 hours
- **Time saved:** 5 hours (40% faster)
