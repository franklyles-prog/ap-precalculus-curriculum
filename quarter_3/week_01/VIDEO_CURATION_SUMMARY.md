## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well ✅
1. **Parallel Agent Workflow**: Video curator ran in background, saved time
2. **Format Decision Process**: Clear PDF vs DOCX analysis led to confident choice
3. **Comprehensive Document**: Students have all info in one place
4. **Chromebook Focus**: Addressed known hyperlink issue proactively
5. **Multiple Creators**: NancyPi + Khan Academy provides learning style variety

### Challenges Encountered ⚠️
1. **Direct YouTube URLs**: Web search couldn't access specific video URLs
   - **Solution**: Provided YouTube search instructions instead
   - **Better for long-term**: Videos won't break if URLs change

2. **MCP Server Limitations**: youtube-manager MCP server not yet configured for direct API access
   - **Workaround**: Used web search and creator knowledge
   - **Future**: Complete MCP setup for direct YouTube API access

3. **DOCX Editing**: Curriculum strategist needs Skill(docx) tool
   - **Status**: Agent working on this now
   - **Verification needed**: Ensure lesson plan formatting preserved

### Improvements for Next Time 🚀
1. **Complete MCP Setup**: Finish youtube-manager and youtube-semantic server configuration
2. **Automate PDF Conversion**: Add document-generator-mcp to workflow
3. **Thumbnail Embedding**: Include video thumbnails in PDF for visual navigation
4. **Duration Verification**: Access YouTube API to get exact video durations
