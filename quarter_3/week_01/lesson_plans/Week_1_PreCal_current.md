  -------------- --------------------- ----------------- ---------------------

**SESSION 1: JANUARY 7, 2026**

**Critical Question (1): What do you want students to know and be able
to do?**

Students will review right triangle trigonometry (sine, cosine, tangent)
using SOH-CAH-TOA. They will understand radian measure as the arc length
on a unit circle when radius equals one. Students will convert between
degrees and radians using the conversion formulas. They will calculate
arc length using the formula s = rθ when the angle is measured in
radians.

**Critical Question (2): How will you know when students have mastered
the learning?**

Exit ticket with 4 problems: (1) Find sin, cos, tan for a given right
triangle, (2) Convert 120° to radians, (3) Convert 2π/3 to degrees, (4)
Calculate arc length given radius and central angle in radians. Mastery
= 3 out of 4 correct with work shown. Observation during guided practice
and completion of daily assignment with 80% accuracy.

**Critical Question (3): What will you do when students have not
mastered the learning?**

Provide conversion formula reference cards for students to keep. Use
physical demonstrations (string and circular objects) to reinforce the
radian concept. Conduct small group reteaching during Session 2 bell
ringer time. Assign additional practice problems with step-by-step
solution guides. Create visual aids showing the correspondence between
common degree measures and their radian equivalents on the unit circle.

**Critical Question (4): What will you do when students have mastered
the learning?**

Provide challenge problems involving multiple unit conversions and arc
length calculations in real-world contexts such as pendulum motion,
circular motion in physics, and gear ratios. Have students explore why
radians are considered \"natural\" units in mathematics and their
connection to calculus (particularly derivatives of trigonometric
functions). Allow students to preview unit circle coordinates and begin
identifying special angle values.

**SESSION 2: JANUARY 9, 2026**

**Critical Question (1): What do you want students to know and be able
to do?**

Students will build the unit circle systematically using special right
triangles (30-60-90 and 45-45-90). They will find exact coordinates for
special angles (π/6, π/4, π/3, π/2) in Quadrant I. Students will use
reference angles and symmetry to extend coordinates to all four
quadrants. They will understand sign patterns across quadrants and
calculate all six trigonometric functions from unit circle coordinates.

**Critical Question (2): How will you know when students have mastered
the learning?**

Exit ticket with 5 problems: (1) Find coordinates for π/4, (2) Find
coordinates for 5π/6 using reference angle, (3) Calculate sin(2π/3), (4)
Find all six trig functions for 3π/4, (5) Explain sign pattern in
Quadrant III. Mastery = 4/5 correct. Weekly homework (40 problems) due
Monday.

**Critical Question (3): What will you do when students have not
mastered the learning?**

Provide blank unit circle templates for practice. Create visual
reference sheets with special triangle values color-coded. Use quadrant
sign chart (All Students Take Calculus). Small group Monday focusing on
special triangles and reference angles. Partner flashcard practice.
Online interactive unit circle tool.

**Critical Question (4): What will you do when students have mastered
the learning?**

Begin Project 1: Create artistic Unit Circle Master Reference with all
special angles, coordinates, and derivations. Explore how unit circle
\"unwinds\" to create sine and cosine graphs. Preview sum/difference
angles. Real-world applications: circular motion, waves, oscillations.
Challenge: Derive exact values for π/8 and π/12.
