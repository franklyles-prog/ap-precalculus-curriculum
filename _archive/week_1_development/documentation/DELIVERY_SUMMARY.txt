  Total Session: ~60 minutes

GRADING PHILOSOPHY:
  - Emphasis on process over answer
  - Partial credit for correct method
  - Growth mindset approach to Part C
  - Celebrate effort and reasoning

PARTIAL CREDIT EXAMPLES:
  - Problem 1: 2 pts for sin²(θ) + cos²(θ) = 1 approach, 1 pt if answer only

  - Problem 34: Multi-part ACT challenge with sub-questions a, b, c, d

COMMON STUDENT ERRORS (documented in answer key):
  - Confusing opposite and adjacent sides
  - Multiplying vs. dividing in degree/radian conversion
  - Using wrong trigonometric function for word problems
  - Forgetting to include radius in arc length
  - Confusing angle of elevation vs. angle of depression
  - Forgetting the Pythagorean theorem when finding third side

EXTENSION SUGGESTIONS (in answer key):
  - "Why is the formula simpler in radians than degrees?"
  - "Verify with Pythagorean theorem"
  - "What if the condition was different?"
  - Connection to calculus (radians being "natural")
  - Real-world follow-up questions

   - Attempt Part C (it's okay to struggle - that's where learning happens!)

2. USE THE FORMULA REFERENCE:
   - Keep the reference box visible while working
   - It's there to support you, not as a "cheat" - mathematicians use references!
