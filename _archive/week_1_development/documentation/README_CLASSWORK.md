### Document Structure

**Header Information:**
- Title: AP Precalculus Classwork - Week 1
- Sessions: January 7 & 9, 2026
- Topic: Right Triangle Trig & Introduction to Radians
- Standards: PC.TR.1, PC.TR.2, PC.TR.3, PC.TR.4

**Learning Objectives (SWBAT):**
1. Apply SOH-CAH-TOA to solve right triangles
2. Convert angle measures between degrees and radians
3. Identify and evaluate special angles (30°, 45°, 60°) on the unit circle
4. Understand radians as arc length on the unit circle

### Part A: Basic Skills (40% - 15 problems)
**Target: 80%+ accuracy**

Problems 1-15 focus on:
- Direct application of SOH-CAH-TOA
- Radian/degree conversion practice
- Special angle identification
- Straightforward trig ratio calculations

Example: "Convert 45° to radians"
Complexity: Procedural, one-step solutions
Support: Formula reference box, worked examples

### Part B: Intermediate Skills (40% - 15 problems)
**Target: 60-70% accuracy**

Problems 16-30 focus on:
- Multi-step problem solving
- Real-world applications (ladder angles, Ferris wheels, pendulums)
- Combined concepts (conversions + arc length)
- Word problems requiring setup and interpretation

Example: "A ladder leans against a wall, making a 50° angle with the ground. If the ladder is 20 feet long, how high does it reach on the wall?"
Complexity: Requires identifying the problem setup, selecting appropriate trig function, and solving
Support: Worked example B provided

**ACT Integration:**
- Problem 29: "A sector of a circle with radius 4 has a central angle of π/3. What is the perimeter of this sector?"

### Part C: Challenge Problems (20% - 5 problems)
**Target: 40-50% accuracy (struggle is expected)**

Problems 31-35 focus on:
- Proof and mathematical reasoning
- Why radians are "natural" for mathematics
- Preview of angle difference formulas
- Extension to 3D geometry

Includes:
- Pythagorean identity proof
- Conceptual understanding questions
- ACT Challenge problem (multi-part)
- 3D cone geometry extension

   - Part B example: Arc length calculation on unit circle
   - Both include step-by-step solutions
   - Common errors highlighted in red

3. **Visual Support**
   - Problem statements clearly formatted
   - Answer blanks clearly marked
   - Adequate white space for work
   - Table formatting for organized reference

4. **Built-in Differentiation**
   - Part A: Quick-win confidence builders
   - Part B: Real-world problem solving
   - Part C: Extensions and connections
   - All problems use consistent formatting

## Answer Key Features

### For Teachers

**Comprehensive Solutions:**
- Every problem solved completely
- Step-by-step work shown
- Common student errors identified for each problem
- Extension questions for advanced learners

**Grading Guidance:**
- Point values for each problem type
- Partial credit rubrics
- Example: "2 pts for correct answer, 1 pt if answer is 45π/180 (unreduced)"

**Student Error Documentation:**
- Part A Error Examples:
  - "Students often confuse 'opposite' and 'adjacent'"
  - "Some students write 'π/90' - they divided instead of multiplied"

- Part B Error Examples:
  - "Students confuse angle of depression with angle of elevation"
  - "Using sine or cosine instead of tangent"

- Part C Error Examples:
  - "Students might try to convert 1 radian to degrees unnecessarily"

**Extensions for Advanced Students:**
- "Why is the formula simpler in radians than degrees?"
- "Verify: 30/360 × circumference = 30/360 × 2π(12) = 2π"
- "This is the famous 7-24-25 Pythagorean triple!"

### Overall Grading Summary

- Problem 34: ACT Challenge (multi-part sector problem)
- Problems emphasize calculator vs. mental math appropriately

**Rigorous Problem Progression:**
- Starts with SOH-CAH-TOA foundational work
- Moves to degree/radian conversions
- Progresses to real-world applications
- Extends to abstract mathematical reasoning

## Usage Notes

### For Students
- Part A should take 15-20 minutes (mostly quick answers)
- Part B should take 25-35 minutes (showing work required)
- Part C should take 15-25 minutes (exploratory, collaborative)
- Total time: ~60 minutes of focused classwork

### For Teachers

**Pacing Suggestions:**
- **Day 1 (Session 1, Jan 7):** Complete Part A as guided practice
- **Day 1 (Session 1, Jan 7):** Start Part B - begin with worked example
- **Day 2 (Session 2, Jan 9):** Finish Part B, tackle Part C
- **Homework:** Review classwork, prepare for Quiz 1

**Grading Recommendations:**
- Part A: Quick assessment of foundational skills (might be homework)
- Part B: Formal grading with rubric (shows problem-solving ability)
- Part C: Growth mindset grading (attempt > perfection)

**Differentiation In Action:**
- Advanced students: Extend Part C, add bonus problems
