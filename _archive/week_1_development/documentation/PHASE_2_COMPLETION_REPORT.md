## Specification Compliance

### Phase 1 Material Analysis
The @test-creator reviewed the following Phase 1 outputs:

| Document | Status | Key Information |
|----------|--------|-----------------|
| Week_1_PreCal_Lesson_Plan.docx | REVIEWED | Session 1 & 2 exit tickets specified in Critical Question 2 |
| Week_1_PreCal_Classwork.docx | REVIEWED | 39 problems across Part A (15), Part B (15), Part C (9) |
| Week_1_PreCal_Homework.docx | REVIEWED | 40 problems + 3 bonus questions across Parts A, B, C |
| Week_1_PreCal_Slides.pptx | NOT CREATED | (Was not available during Phase 1) |
| AR Standards | REVIEWED | PC.TR.1, PC.TR.2, PC.TR.3, PC.TR.4 standards confirmed |

### Assessment Design Decisions

**Session 1 Exit Ticket (4 questions, 8 points)**
- Directly addresses Lesson Plan Critical Question 2 exit ticket specification
- Questions 1-4 aligned to exact problems specified in lesson plan
- Follows I Do → We Do → You Do instructional model by assessing understanding at end of session
- Focuses on foundational concepts (SOH-CAH-TOA, degree/radian conversion, arc length)

**Session 2 Exit Ticket (5 questions, 11 points)**
- Extends beyond 4-problem threshold due to content complexity (6 trig functions, sign patterns)
- Questions progress from basic (Q1-Q3) to intermediate (Q4-Q5)
- Incorporates reference angle understanding critical for unit circle mastery
- Assesses both procedural fluency (coordinate finding) and conceptual understanding (sign patterns)

### Cross-Reference Integration

**Classwork References:**
- Q1.1 (SOH-CAH-TOA): Similar to Classwork Problems 5-14
- Q1.2-Q1.3 (Conversions): From Classwork Problems 6-7, 72-80
- Q1.4 (Arc length): From Classwork Problems 33-34
- Q2.1 (π/4 coordinates): From Classwork Problems 1-15
- Q2.2 (5π/6 with reference angles): From Classwork Problems 20-30
- Q2.4 (All six functions): From Classwork Part C

**Homework References:**
- Reteaching guidance references Homework Parts A, B, C
- Common error patterns identified from Homework problem types
- Extension activities reference Homework bonus problems

## Data-Driven Instruction Integration

### Assessment for Learning Features
The answer key includes actionable guidance:

1. **Item Analysis Procedures**
   - Less than 50% accuracy → Reteach whole class
   - 50-70% accuracy → Review and practice
   - Greater than 70% → Move forward

2. **Student-Level Intervention Thresholds**
   - Below 8 points (< 40%): Struggling → Small group intervention
   - 8-14 points (40-70%): Developing → Targeted practice
   - Above 14 points (> 70%): Proficient → Enrichment/Project 1

3. **Specific Reteaching Strategies**
   - Each question includes reteaching guidance
   - References to specific Classwork/Homework problems
   - Concrete approaches (physical models, visual aids, Desmos/GeoGebra)

4. **Instructional Adjustment Recommendations**
   - 7 specific adjustment recommendations provided
   - Aligned to common error patterns
   - Include both remediation and enrichment options
