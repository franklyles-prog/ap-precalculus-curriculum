## COMMON STUDENT MISCONCEPTIONS & RESPONSES

### Session 1

3. **"180° = π is confusing"**
   - Response: "Memorize it: 180° = π rad. All other conversions come from this."

### Session 2
1. **"The coordinates are too complicated"**
   - Response: "Start with special triangles. Once you see the pattern (√1/2, √2/2, √3/2), it clicks!"

2. **"Why do we switch from sin to y-coordinate?"**
   - Response: "Because on a unit circle with radius 1, y-value IS the sine value. They're the same!"

3. **"I can't remember which quadrant has which sign"**
   - Response: "Use ASTC: All Students Take Calculus. This rhyme will stick with you!"

## EXTENDED LEARNING CONNECTIONS

### Mathematics
- **Calculus Preview:** "When we take derivatives, radians make trig functions beautiful. sin'(θ) = cos(θ) only works with radians!"
- **Complex Numbers:** "The unit circle is how we graph complex numbers too!"
- **Periodic Functions:** "The unit circle explains why trig functions repeat."

### Real-World Applications
- **Physics:** Circular motion, pendulum motion, waves
- **Engineering:** Gears, rotating machinery
- **Architecture:** Arches, domes, circular structures
- **Navigation:** Bearings, map projections

## NOTES FOR INSTRUCTIONAL SUCCESS

1. **Pacing:** These lessons move FAST. Be ready to slow down for struggling students. Don't rush the unit circle!

2. **Mistakes:** Expect students to confuse sin/cos initially. This is normal. Use consistent language: "sin gives the y-value, cos gives the x-value."

3. **Formulas:** Have formula cards visible at all times. DON'T make students memorize conversion formulas from scratch.

4. **Diagrams:** Hand-drawn diagrams are often better than perfect computer graphics. Students learn by doing.

5. **Questioning:** Ask open-ended questions: "Why is cos(90°) = 0?" "What would sin(0°) be?" Let them discover answers.

6. **Real-World:** Connect to ACT problems constantly. Show why this matters for their test scores.

7. **Celebration:** Celebrate when students get it. This is hard stuff! Positive feedback keeps them engaged.

## FINAL NOTES

These slides are designed for:
- Maximum clarity and visual organization
- Interactive engagement of ACT 15-22 students
- Scaffolded instruction from basics to complex
- Multiple representations (algebraic, visual, numeric)
- Regular formative assessment
- Opportunity for differentiation

The goal: Take students from "I don't understand trigonometry" to "I can find exact values for any angle using the unit circle" in two 90-minute sessions.

Good luck! You've got this!
