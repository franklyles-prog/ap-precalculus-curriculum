## Assessment Quality Features

### Alignment to Specifications
✓ Session 1: 4 problems as specified in lesson plan
✓ Session 2: 5 problems as specified in lesson plan
✓ Problems directly reference classwork/homework materials
✓ All problems assess SWBAT objectives from lesson plan
✓ Difficulty progression: Basic → Intermediate
✓ Formative, low-stakes format appropriate for ACT 15-22 students

### Cross-References to Phase 1 Materials
- **Classwork Problems:** Sessions 1-2 exit tickets reference specific classwork problems (e.g., "Similar to Classwork Problems 5-14", "From Classwork Part C")
- **Homework Problems:** Reteaching suggestions reference homework problem sets
- **Lesson Plan:** Problem selection based directly on lesson plan exit ticket specifications

### Scaffolding for ACT 15-22 Students
✓ Problems broken into manageable steps
✓ Exact answers emphasized (fractions, π notation) not decimals
✓ Visual/spatial thinking emphasized (coordinates, quadrants)
✓ Reference sheets and formulas integrated into assessment
✓ Partial credit opportunities built into rubrics
✓ Anxiety-reducing language and framing

### Standards Coverage
- **PC.TR.1:** Radian measure (Q1.4)
- **PC.TR.2:** Degree/Radian conversion (Q1.2, Q1.3)
- **PC.TR.3:** Unit circle for six functions (Q2.1-5)
- **PC.TR.4:** Special triangles/exact values (Q2.1-2)

- Small group intervention during Friday session
- Review Classwork Part A problems
- Focus on foundational concepts (SOH-CAH-TOA, basic conversions)
- Use physical models and concrete examples
- May need extended time on assessments

### For Students Scoring 40-70% (8-14 points)
- Additional practice problems from homework
- Partner study/review sessions
- Targeted instruction on specific weak areas
- Review before Unit 1 test (Session 11)

### For Students Scoring 70%+ (14+ points)
- Ready for Week 2 content (Unit circle mastery)
- Engage in Project 1 (Artistic Unit Circle)
- Provide enrichment: derive exact values for π/8, π/12
- Explore applications (circular motion, waves)
