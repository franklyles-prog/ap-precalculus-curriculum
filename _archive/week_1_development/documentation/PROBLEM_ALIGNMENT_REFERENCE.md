**Formula Bank:**
```
Radians = Degrees × (π/180)
Example: 120 × (π/180) = 120π/180 = 2π/3
```

### Question 3: Convert Radians to Degrees
```
Exit Ticket Problem: Convert 2π/3 radians to degrees. Show your work.

Standards: PC.TR.2
SWBAT: Convert radians to degrees using multiplication by 180/π
Answer: 120°
Points: 2
```

- Convert 120° → 2π/3 (Q2)
- Convert 2π/3 → 120° (Q3)
- Should arrive at same values

### Question 4: All Six Trigonometric Functions at 3π/4
```
Exit Ticket Problem: For angle 3π/4, find all six trigonometric functions
(sin, cos, tan, csc, sec, cot).

Standards: PC.TR.3
SWBAT: Calculate all six trigonometric functions from unit circle coordinates
Points: 3
```

**Answers:**
```
Coordinates at 3π/4: (-√2/2, √2/2)

sin(3π/4) = √2/2
cos(3π/4) = -√2/2
tan(3π/4) = -1

csc(3π/4) = √2 (reciprocal of sin)
sec(3π/4) = -√2 (reciprocal of cos)
cot(3π/4) = -1 (reciprocal of tan)
```

**Related Practice Problems:**
| Material | Problems | Topic |
|----------|----------|-------|
| Classwork | Part C | Challenge problems on all six functions |
| Classwork | 36-39 | Extensions and Pythagorean identity (challenge) |
| Homework | 5-10 | "Find all three ratios" for right triangles |
| Homework | 36-40 | Conceptual questions about unit circle |

**Procedure:**
1. Find coordinates: 3π/4 is in Q2, reference angle = π/4
   - cos(3π/4) = -cos(π/4) = -√2/2
   - sin(3π/4) = sin(π/4) = √2/2

2. Primary ratios: sin, cos, tan
   - tan = sin/cos = (√2/2)/(-√2/2) = -1

3. Reciprocal functions: csc, sec, cot
   - csc = 1/sin = 1/(√2/2) = 2/√2 = √2 (rationalize)
   - sec = 1/cos = 1/(-√2/2) = -2/√2 = -√2 (rationalize)
   - cot = 1/tan = 1/(-1) = -1

**Complexity Note:**
This is most challenging problem in exit ticket - combines:
- Reference angle identification
- Quadrant sign rules
- All six trigonometric functions
- Fraction simplification
- Rationalization of denominators

- Negative functions: sin(y), cos(x), csc(1/y), sec(1/x)
- Memory aid: ASTC rule - "Only Tangent positive in Q3"

|----------|----------|-------|
| Lesson Plan | Model | "Sign patterns by quadrant" |
| Classwork | (multiple) | Quadrant identification and sign patterns |
| Homework | 37-40 | Conceptual questions about patterns |

       All positive
Sin  /            \  Cos
positive          positive
  /                    \
 /  Tan negative   \  Cos positive

All Students Take Calculus
Q1: All positive
Q2: Sin positive (rest negative)
Q3: Tan positive (sin, cos negative)
Q4: Cos positive (sin, tan negative)
```

**Coordinate System Approach:**
```
Q3 Analysis:

- sin = y/r = (-)/+ = negative
- cos = x/r = (-)/+ = negative
- tan = y/x = (-)/(-) = positive
- csc = r/y = (+)/(-) = negative
- sec = r/x = (+)/(-) = negative
- cot = x/y = (-)/(-) = positive
