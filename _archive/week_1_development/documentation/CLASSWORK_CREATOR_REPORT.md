Problem 1: In a right triangle, sin(θ) = 3/5. What is cos(θ)?

Solution:
Using sin²(θ) + cos²(θ) = 1:
(3/5)² + cos²(θ) = 1
9/25 + cos²(θ) = 1
cos²(θ) = 16/25
cos(θ) = 4/5

Answer: 4/5 (or 0.8)

Common Error: Students might try to use SOH-CAH-TOA directly
             without remembering the Pythagorean identity.

Partial Credit: 2 pts if work shown, 1 pt if only answer given
