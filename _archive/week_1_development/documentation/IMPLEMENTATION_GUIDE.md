---

## LAYOUT TIPS

1. **Margins:** 0.5 inch minimum on all sides
2. **Text Density:** Maximum 6 bullet points per slide
3. **Visual Balance:** Use diagrams, boxes, and color to break up text
4. **Consistency:** Keep headers in same position on every slide
5. **White Space:** Leave breathing room - don't cram content

## SHAPES TO CREATE FOR KEY DIAGRAMS

### Right Triangle (Slide 5-6)
Use drawing tools to create:
- Vertical line (opposite side, labeled)
- Horizontal line (adjacent side, labeled)
- Diagonal line (hypotenuse, labeled)
- Angle marker at bottom left corner (labeled θ)

### Unit Circle (Slide 21)
Use drawing tools to create:
- Circle (blue outline, no fill or light fill)
- Horizontal and vertical axes through center
- Radius line from center to upper right (π/4 position)
- Mark coordinates at key angles (π/6, π/4, π/3, π/2)

### Special Triangles (Slide 20)
Create two right triangles side by side:
- **Left:** 45-45-90 triangle with sides labeled 1, 1, √2
- **Right:** 30-60-90 triangle with sides labeled 1, √3, 2

---

## ANIMATED ELEMENTS (Optional but Recommended)

These animations engage ACT 15-22 students:

### Slide 3-4 (Bell Ringer)
- Slide 3: Problem displays, stays for 3 min work time
- Slide 4: Solution appears one bullet point at a time

### Slide 6 (Right Triangle Example)
- Triangle appears
- Then sin(θ) = 3/5 appears
- Then cos(θ) = 4/5 appears
- Then tan(θ) = 3/4 appears

### Slide 8-9 (Conversion Formulas)
- Degrees formula appears
- Then radians formula appears
- Then examples appear one at a time

## SPEAKER NOTES TO ADD

In Google Slides or PowerPoint, use the Notes section at bottom:

**Slide 2 (Session 1 Title):**
"Post these learning objectives. Students need to know where we're going. This sets the roadmap for today. Take 2 minutes to review and answer questions about objectives."

**Slide 3-4 (Bell Ringer):**
"Display problem. 2 minutes individual work. 1 minute partner discussion. Don't reveal answer until Slide 4. Use this as formative assessment of prior knowledge."

**Slide 5 (Hook):**
"Build excitement about the question. Show images of ferris wheel, clock, pizza. Discuss: we measure in degrees, but is there a better way? Coming up..."

**[Add similar notes for each slide from the detailed guide]**

## TESTING THE PRESENTATION

Before using in class:

1. **Display Test:** Project on classroom screen/smartboard
   - Check text readability from back of room
   - Verify colors display correctly
   - Test any embedded videos or links

2. **Navigation Test:** Practice moving between slides
   - Keyboard shortcuts work smoothly
   - Animations display properly (if used)

3. **Content Check:** Verify all mathematical content
   - Equations are correct (use calculator to verify)
   - Coordinate values are exact (not approximations)
   - Examples have been worked through

4. **Timing Test:** Go through presentation at teaching pace
   - Are there enough slides for 90 minutes?
   - Is pacing realistic?
   - Do interactive elements slow things down?

## TROUBLESHOOTING

### Problem: Slides don't display correctly on projector
**Solution:**
- Test on actual projector before class
- Check resolution (16:9 aspect ratio)
- Adjust color/contrast settings

### Problem: Text is too small to read
**Solution:**
- Minimum 18pt for body text
- Minimum 26pt for headers
- Test from back of classroom

### Problem: Animations are choppy
**Solution:**
- Reduce number of animations
- Use simple "Appear" instead of complex effects
- Update software/drivers

### Problem: Formulas don't display correctly
**Solution:**
- Use Arial font (not special math fonts)
- For √, use: \sqrt{x}
- For π, use: π symbol (insert → symbol)
- For fractions: use forward slash or fraction format
