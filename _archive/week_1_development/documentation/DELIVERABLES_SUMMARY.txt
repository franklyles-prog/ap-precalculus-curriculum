================================================================================
COMMON STUDENT MISCONCEPTIONS
================================================================================

SESSION 1:
1. "Sine equals the angle in degrees"
   → Response: "sin(30°) = 0.5, not 30. Sine is a RATIO."

2. "Why do we need radians?"
   → Response: "Radians are natural for calculus."

3. "180° = π is confusing"
   → Response: "Memorize this. All conversions come from it."

SESSION 2:
1. "Coordinates are too complicated"
   → Response: "Start with special triangles. See the PATTERN!"

2. "Why do we use y-coordinate for sine?"
   → Response: "On unit circle with r=1, y-value IS sine."

3. "Can't remember quadrant signs"
   → Response: "Use ASTC: All Students Take Calculus."
