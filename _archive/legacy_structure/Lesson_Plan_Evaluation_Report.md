# Lesson Plan Evaluation Report
## AP Precalculus - Sessions 1 and 2 (January 7 and January 9, 2026)

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Both existing lesson plans demonstrate strong pedagogical structure and appropriate scaffolding for the target student population (ACT Math 15-22). The plans follow a consistent template with clear learning objectives, differentiated instruction, and multiple assessment strategies. However, there are opportunities to strengthen AP-level rigor while maintaining accessibility.

**Overall Rating: B+ (Good with room for enhancement)**

## EVALUATION CRITERIA

### 1. ALIGNMENT WITH AP PRECALCULUS STANDARDS

#### Session 1 (January 7) - Right Triangle Trig & Radians
**Standards Addressed:**
- PC.TR.1: Understand radian measure of an angle as the length of the arc on the unit circle subtended by the angle
- PC.TR.2: Convert between radian and degree measure

**Evaluation:** STRONG ALIGNMENT
- Lesson correctly addresses foundational standards
- Appropriate scaffolding from geometry (SOH-CAH-TOA) to precalculus concepts
- Arc length formula (s = r theta) included appropriately

**Recommendation:** Add explicit connection to why radians simplify calculus (derivatives of trig functions), even as preview/motivation.

#### Session 2 (January 9) - Unit Circle
**Standards Addressed:**
- PC.TR.3: Explain how the unit circle can be used to model sine, cosine, tangent, secant, cosecant, and cotangent for all real numbers
- PC.TR.4: Construct special right triangles on the unit circle to find exact values for pi/3, pi/4, pi/6, and pi/2

**Evaluation:** EXCELLENT ALIGNMENT
- Comprehensive coverage of special angles
- Good use of reference angles
- All six trig functions addressed

**Recommendation:** Consider adding standard position angle definition and terminal side concept more explicitly.

### 2. APPROPRIATENESS FOR STUDENT LEVEL (ACT 15-22)

#### Strengths:
1. **Concrete to Abstract Progression:** Both lessons start with concrete, familiar concepts (geometry triangles) before moving to abstract (unit circle)

2. **Multiple Representations:** Visual (diagrams, posters), kinesthetic (string/paper plates), and symbolic approaches

3. **Scaffolded Practice:** Problems progress from basic to complex with clear structure (Part A, B, C)

4. **Memory Aids:** SOH-CAH-TOA, "All Students Take Calculus" mnemonic for quadrant signs

5. **Intervention Planning:** Both lessons include specific intervention strategies for struggling learners

#### Areas for Improvement:
1. **Prerequisite Check:** Add diagnostic assessment at start to identify specific geometry gaps

2. **Worked Examples:** Include more step-by-step worked examples in guided practice

3. **Error Analysis:** Add common mistakes/misconceptions section

4. **Calculator Integration:** More explicit guidance on when to use calculators vs. exact values

- Observation during guided practice noted
- Daily assignment completion tracked

**Strengths:**
- Clear mastery criteria (3/4 or 4/5 correct)
- Multiple assessment modalities

**Recommendations:**
1. Add self-assessment component for metacognition
2. Include peer assessment opportunity
3. Create error pattern tracking for intervention

#### Summative Assessment Planning:
- Session 2 introduces Project 1 (Artistic Unit Circle)
- Weekly homework assigned (40 problems)

**Recommendations:**
1. Add quiz after Session 4 or 5
2. Include unit test blueprint
3. Create cumulative review schedule

### 5. DIFFERENTIATION STRATEGIES

#### For Struggling Learners (Intervention):
**Session 1:**
