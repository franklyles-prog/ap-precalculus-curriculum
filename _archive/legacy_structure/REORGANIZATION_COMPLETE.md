**Date:** January 2, 2026
**Method:** Parallel Agent Execution (4 agents)
**Execution Time:** ~2 minutes

---

## ✅ What Was Done

### 1. **Created Quarter-Based Structure**
```
precal/
├── quarter_3/          # Jan 7 - Mar 13, 2026
│   ├── week_01/
│   ├── week_02/
│   ├── ... (weeks 3-10)
│
└── quarter_4/          # Mar 24 - May 1, 2026
    ├── week_01/
    ├── ... (weeks 2-6)
```

### 2. **Standardized Week Structure**
Each week has consistent subdirectories:
```
week_XX/
├── assessments/        # Exit tickets, formative/summative tests
├── assignments/        # Classwork, homework, answer keys
├── lesson_plans/       # Weekly lesson plan documents
└── presentations/      # PowerPoint slides for sessions
```

### 3. **Migrated Week 1 Files**
**8 files** successfully moved to `quarter_3/week_01/`:

**📋 Assessments (2 files)**
- Week_1_PreCal_Assessment.docx (28K)
- Week_1_PreCal_Key_Assessment.docx (40K)

**📝 Assignments (4 files)**
- Week_1_PreCal_Classwork.docx (30K)
- Week_1_PreCal_Key_Classwork.docx (41K)
- Week_1_PreCal_Homework.docx (15K)
- Week_1_PreCal_Key_Homework.docx (17K)

**📖 Lesson Plans (1 file)**
- Week_1_PreCal.docx (21K)

**📊 Presentations (1 file)**
- Week_1_Session1_Slides.pptx (167K)

### 4. **Archived Legacy Files**
**20 files** moved to `_archive/week_1_development/`:
- **Documentation**: READMEs, reports, guides, summaries
- **Scripts**: Creation scripts (Python/JavaScript) used for initial development

### 5. **Cleaned Up Old Structure**
Removed legacy directories:
- ❌ `week_1/` (now empty)
- ❌ `lesson_plans/` (now empty)

## 📊 Parallel Agent Execution

**4 specialized agents worked simultaneously:**

| Agent | Task | Files Moved | Status |
|-------|------|-------------|--------|
| **assessment-reorganizer** | Moved assessment files | 2 | ✅ Complete |
| **assignment-reorganizer** | Moved classwork/homework | 4 | ✅ Complete |
| **presentation-reorganizer** | Moved presentation slides | 1 | ✅ Complete |
| **lessonplan-reorganizer** | Moved lesson plans | 1 | ✅ Complete |

**Efficiency Gain:** ~75% faster than sequential processing

## 🗂️ New File Locations

### Quick Reference

**All Week 1 materials are now located at:**
```
/Users/franklyles/Documents/Claude Stuff/Disciplines/precal/quarter_3/week_01/
```

**Archived development files:**
```
/Users/franklyles/Documents/Claude Stuff/Disciplines/precal/_archive/week_1_development/
```

## 📝 Next Steps

### For Week 2+ Materials:
1. Create materials using existing agent workflows
2. Save directly to appropriate week directory:
   - Quarter 3: `quarter_3/week_02/` through `quarter_3/week_10/`
   - Quarter 4: `quarter_4/week_01/` through `quarter_4/week_06/`

### Directory Structure Available:
- ✅ All 10 weeks for Quarter 3
- ✅ All 6 weeks for Quarter 4
- ✅ Each week has all 4 subdirectories ready

## 🎯 Benefits

1. **Chronological Organization** - Materials grouped by teaching timeline
2. **Scalability** - Easy to add new weeks
3. **Consistency** - Same structure for every week
4. **Easy Navigation** - Teachers can quickly find "Quarter 3, Week 5"
5. **Clean Archive** - Development history preserved but separated

## 📌 File Naming Convention

Files use this pattern:
```
Week_[#]_PreCal_[Type].docx
Week_[#]_Session[#]_Slides.pptx
Week_[#]_PreCal_Key_[Type].docx
```

**Examples:**
- `Week_1_PreCal_Classwork.docx` → Student worksheet
- `Week_1_PreCal_Key_Classwork.docx` → Answer key
- `Week_1_Session1_Slides.pptx` → Presentation for Session 1
